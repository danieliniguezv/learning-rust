# Chapter 1

In this chapter we were introduced to learn how to:
1. Install Rust.
2. Create a simple program, compile it, and build an executable using 
`rustc` compiler.
3. Create a project using `Cargo`. `Cargo` is Rust's build system and package
manager. We:
    - Created a project with `cargo new`.
    - Built the project with `cargo build`.
    - Ran the program with `cargo run`.
    - Compiled the program (no binary build output) with `cargo check`.
    - Learned that for building final releases we'll use `cargo build --release`.
